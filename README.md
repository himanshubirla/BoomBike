# Boom Bike
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## Conclusions


In order to grow start promotions in weather situation like snow + rain + thunderstrom and in spring season. Majority of driving factors are natural factors, you an not control them , you can offer discounts or some promotions in order to increase the demand.

Or, on an alternative, you can reduce the price or offer promotion in the normal weather situation and season other than spring inorder to attract more customers then, because chances of getting more customers are realistic then. If you get higher number of customers then , you will be able to cover for offseason period . Hence you can increase the prices during off-season. What it means is if you run promotion/discount during your season time and if you are able to attract atleast 20% more customers than usual and give them at discounted price , you will be having more profit, through which you can cover for your off season.

eg. Let say last year during your season time(for 3 months), every day you got 100 customers for bike rentals , you gave them at rental cost of 40 grands. Total earning you made is 4000 grands/day and 360000 grands for 3 months. This year you offered discount, you got 150 customers each day during your season time, total earning you made 5250 grands/day and 472500 grands for 3 months). Hence you made profit of 112500 grands.
